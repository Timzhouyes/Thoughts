# 1. What is Angular
Angular is a framework for people to do the data-binding and changes on website of UI more easily.

AngularJS is the 1st edition of Angular.

#### The difference between AngularJS and Angular is that
1. Angular is based on TypeScript and Angular is based on TypeScript, which is a opensourced language developed by Microsoft.
2. AngularJs uses terms of **Scope** and **Controller** .AngularJS also has a **rootScope** for whole application
- My own understand of **Scope** is a link between controller and view.When we add a *$scope* in controller, HTML file can get these attributes directlhy and just use it .
- The difference between one-way data binding and two-way databinding is that one-way data binding only can get data from model and post them on the Views, but if we use two-way databinding, if we change data on Views, it can also change data in models.So one is from model to view, one is two-directions view and models.

# 2. Study Angular toturial on its own website
