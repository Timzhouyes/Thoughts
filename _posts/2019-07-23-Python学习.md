Yes.

Learn Python the hard way.

So this blog is a studying note for me to record things I think important or difficult :) And also a place for me to write down my own thinking.

Let's Go!

# The Hard way is easier

3 essential skills of coding:

1. Reading and writing
2. Attention to detail:such as corner case
3. Spotting differences

# Ex3. Numbers and Math

The order of operations:

1. Parentheses(圆括号)
2. Exponents（指数）
3. Multiplication
4. Devision
5. Addition
6. Subtraction

# Ex5. More variables and printing

This exercise taught how to make format in strings.

Just put format like:

`print(f"This is for formatting string like {this.variable}")`

And also there is format like:

```python
filling_in=False
joke_blank="Here is a blank for people to {}"
print(joke_blank.format(filling_in))
```
