# Django at a glance

Here are summaries of what Django is better.

### Design the model

The ORM(Object-relational mapper) can make user describe the database layout in Python code. 

### Dynamic admin interface

Django can automatically create a professional, production ready administrative interface.

So managing the whole system is very easy with Django.

### Design your URLs

By using Python module called URLconf, can design simple mapping between URL patterns and Python callback functions. It can also decouple URLs from Python code.

### Write your views

View is responsible for doing 2 kind of things: one is returning HttpResponse object containing the content fir the requested page, one is raising exception such as Http404.

### Design your templates

Django has a template search path, which can minimize redundancy among templates.
