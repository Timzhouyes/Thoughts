# Today's record:
1. In Angular, the basic logic is that one component/one thing is composed of one .js file and one .html file .The .js file contains functions of the thing , and the .html file contains apperance of the thing. One is logic, one is apperaence
2. 

# 1. VSM
VSM is a tool to analyse the whole process line. To draw a VSM ,first thing is to figure out the original process of production line, including all the processes such as from the shipping part and then every part we need in the process.

Then , we need to analyse through some methods , such as proccesses can change to flow production, supermarket pull, Kanban pull ,FIFO and others, like reduce the stock in inventory.

The third part is to draw a "future ideal VSM" ,and improve the process line through it.
